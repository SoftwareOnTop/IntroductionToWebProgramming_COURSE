This week your task is to develop a game with Phaser. You can create the game of your taste. Platformer, tank shooting, Angry birds stylish...

1. Create a simple game (1 point)
Follow for example the lecture video and build a game where player can move around.


2. Add other moving parts (3 points)
Add enemies, collectible items or any other things player can interact. It is required to have something more than in the lecture demo. You can for example have different kind of items to collect (some give more points than others – with different colors).

3. Communication with other parts (5 points)
Add something the player can "communicate" with. This means shooting, catching (collecting stars is NOT enough) running parts or something like that.
